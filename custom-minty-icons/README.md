# Custom Mint-Y Icons

Custom application icons made using existing [Moka Icons](https://github.com/snwh/moka-icon-theme) modified to be used as templates. Most new icons use an original app icon that is placed on a template. These icons might not meet all the quality standards of Moka Icons, so submission is unlikely. To use these icons, open `usr/share/applications` as root in Nemo, and modify the .desktop files to use the new icons in the properties window.
Templates are gimp projects.
